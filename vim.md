```

### FILE

:open <file>  
:e  
Ctrl-^, (edit alternate/previous file, like ":e #").
```

(z looks like a folded piece of paper)

There is also zM and zR to close / open all the folds in the file  
za toggle folds (zo/zc)
```

### GLOBAL

https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Power_of_g

```
(ex :g/alf/norm gUU -> uppercase lines where "alf" is present)  
(ex: :g/console/g/two/d -> find "console", then "two" inside it, then delete)  

change delimiters, :g@console@d
g@one@s+const+let+g (use global and sub)    

:g => :1,$g or :%g
:g/^#/y A (append comment in "a" register)
(Register "e replace, "E append in e)
:g!/;$/norm A; (add ; only if not find)
:g/^#/norm 0x (decrease the depth of markdown title)

:g/pattern/<cmd> execute command on all lines
:g/NOTE/m$ (move all line containing NOTE to eof)
:g/^\s*$/d (Delete all blank lines)

:g/^/pu =\"\n\" (space after all lines)
:.,$g/Lesson/exe "norm! A;" (add ; to end of line containing "Lesson" from line to eof)

(effect of these two command ?)
qaq:g/pattern/y A (Copy all lines matching a pattern to register 'a'.)
:5,18g/^foo/s/^.\{-}=/

:v/... or :g!/...   (do NOT match grep)
